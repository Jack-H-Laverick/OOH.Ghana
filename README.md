# OOH.Ghana

This repository houses the code for parameterising the end to end
ecosystem model strathE2E for the Ghanaian Shelf. Scripts are loosely classified into families
-*bathymetry*-*fish*-*flows*-*nemo-medusa*-*saltless*-*StrathE2E*. R scripts
and Figures are self-explanatory directories.

This work is part of One Ocean HUb. The in house R packages used for these projects 
(*MiMeMo.tools*, *nemomedusR*, *slabR*) were developed under the MiMeMo project.
